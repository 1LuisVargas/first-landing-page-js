# First Landing Page – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This is my first web development project: a responsive personal landing page built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It works as a simple portfolio-style page to introduce myself, showcase my tech stack, and play with basic DOM interactions.
